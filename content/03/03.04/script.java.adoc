One common example is the problem of plurals. Suppose we want to place Lucy and Sean just 1 metre apart:

include::../code/java/03--step03-use-singular-metre/shouty/src/test/resources/shouty/shout.feature[lines=4]
----

shot::[2]
Because weâ€™ve used the singular `metre` instead of the plural `metres` we don't get a match:

What a pain!

Fear not. We can just surround the `s` in parentheses to make it optional, like this: shot::[3]

include::../code/java/03--step03-use-singular-metre/shouty/src/test/java/shouty/StepDefinitions.java[lines=16..17]

Now our step matches:

This is one way to smooth off some of the rough edges in your cucumber expressions, and allow your scenarios to be as expressive as possible.

Another is to allow _alternates_ - different ways of saying the same thing. For example, to accept this step: shot::[5]

include::../code/java/05--step05-allow-standing-or-located-as-alternates/shouty/src/test/resources/shouty/shout.feature[lines=4]

...we can use this Cucumber Expression: shot::[6]

include::../code/java/05--step05-allow-standing-or-located-as-alternates/shouty/src/test/java/shouty/StepDefinitions.java[lines=16..17]

shot::[7]
Now we can use either 'standing' or 'located' in our scenarios, and both will match just fine:
