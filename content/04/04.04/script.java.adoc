There are a couple of different ways to create this network instance in Java. The most straightforward is to create a network field and initialize it in the declaration. Every time Cucumber runs a scenario it creates a new instance of your steps class, so we’ll get a fresh instance of the Network for each scenario.

// Network as instance field

As an alternative, that can be useful if you have more complex setup to do, you can use a hook.

shot::[1]
// Using a Before hook

We need an instance of Network in every scenario, so we can declare a Before Hook that creates one before each scenario starts, like this:

Now we can use that Network instance as we create Lucy and Sean in these two new steps.

It should be working again now. Let’s run cucumber to check.

Good. Let’s do the same with the other scenario.

shot::[1]
// Copy and paste in feature file

shot::[1]
// Maven

Now we can remove this old step definition. We know we'll need something like this in the future when we implement the proximity rule, but we don't want to second-guess what that code will look like, so let's clean it out for now.

shot::[1]
// Delete lucy_is_located_m_from_Sean

shot::[1]
// run Maven

Now we have one last bit of dead code left, the move_to method on Person. Let's clean that up too.

shot::[1]
// delete move_to

shot::[1]
// run Maven
