Transpose (0:54)

open feature file

Now the way we’ve specified this data is OK, but it’s quite hard to visualise where each of the people is stood. It might be better to express it like this instead:

| name     | Sean | Lucy | Larry |
| location | 0    | 100  | 150   |

Do you like that better? You do, but you’re worried how we’ll handle it in our step definition? Fear not. Cucumber has you covered.

<ruby>
The Data Table has a transpose method which returns a new DataTable where each row is turned into a column.

add call to transpose

Now we can use the transposed table object as we did before.

Let’s tidy up this code so as not to keep using all these temporary variables.

removes all the `table =` bits and uses dots instead.
</ruby>

<java>
If you annotate the method parameter with the @Transpose annotation, Cucumber will turn each row into a column before passing it to the step definition. You can also call the transpose method on a DataTable to explicitly create a new transposed DataTable.
</java>
Introduce Data Table for Outcome Step

Data tables are very useful for setting up data in Given steps, but you can also use them for specifying outcomes.

One rule that we’ve been implying but have never actually explored with an example is that people remember everything they’ve heard. So far we’ve only specified a single message, so let’s try writing a scenario where Sean shouts more than once:

Scenario: Two shouts
  When Sean shouts "Free bagels!"
  And Sean shouts "Free toast!"
  Then Lucy hears the following messages:
    | Free bagels |
    | Free toast  |

See how natural it is to use a Data Table here? We also haven’t used any column headers in this case, since the data is all in a single column anyway.

So how do we implement this step definition? Well, the DataTable has a really handy method called diff! that we can use to compare two Data Tables. diff! will pass if the tables are the same, and fail if they’re different.

So we need the actual messages that Lucy’s heard to be stored in an object that looks like a DataTable, so we can compare it to the ones we expect.

<ruby>
A two-dimensional Array will do, so we can just map over Lucy’s messages and create a new single-item Array for each row.

Now we can pass that two-dimensional Array to the diff method on the table of expected messages passed in from the Gherkin.

Then(/^Lucy hears the following messages:$/) do |expected_messages|
  lucy = @people['Lucy']
  actual_messages = lucy.messages_heard.map { |message| [ message ] }
  expected_messages.diff!(actual_messages)
end

</ruby>

<java>
A List of List of String will do, so we can just iterate over Lucy’s messages and create a new single-item List for each row.

Now we can pass that list to the diff method on the table of expected messages passed in from the Gherkin.
</java>

runs cucumber

<ruby>
Oops! It looks like we made a typo in our scenario. We should have included exclamation marks on the expected messages. Well, at least this gives you a chance to see the nice diff output from Cucumber when the tables are different. We see the expected values in orange, and the actual values in white.

Let’s fix just one of these so you can see how the diff output changes.

changes bagels to bagels! in the feature.

The matching bagels! line is green, and for the mismatched row, the actual output is white, and the expected output is orange.

Let’s fix this last typo, and we should be green again.

Great.
</ruby>
<java>
Oops! It looks like we made a typo in our scenario. We should have included exclamation marks on the expected messages. Well, at least this gives you a chance to see the nice diff output from Cucumber when the tables are different. We see the expected values prefixed with a minus, and the actual values prefixed with a plus.

Let’s fix just one of these so you can see how the diff output changes.

changes bagels to bagels! in the feature.

The matching bagels! line no longer has a minus, and for the mismatched row, the actual value still has a minus, and the expected value has a plus.

Let’s fix this last typo, and we should be green again.

Great.
</java>

Implement long message rule (1:37)

When writing scenarios, occasionally we want to use a really long piece of data.

For example, let’s introduce a new rule about the maximum length of a message

rule:  max length of message is 180 characters

...and add a scenario to illustrate it, making the string just over the boundary of the rule:

Scenario: Message is too long
  When Sean shouts "123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890x"
  Then nobody hears Sean's message

That’s pretty ugly isn’t it!

Still, we’ll press on and get it to green, then we’ll show you how to clean it up.

Our existing step definition handles that ugly step with the long message just fine, but we need a new step definition for this last outcome step.

We’ll iterate over all the people in the scenario and check they haven’t heard this message.

Then(/^nobody hears Sean's message$/) do
  @people.values.each do |person|
    expect(person.messages_heard).to_not include @message_from_sean
  end
end

runs cucumber

OK, so we have a failing acceptance test. Let’s dive down into our solution and implement this new rule. It seems like the Network should be responsible for implementing this rule, so let’s go to its unit tests and add a new example to specify this extra responsibility:

it "does not broadcast messages over 180 characters, even when the listener is within range" do
  sean_location = 0
  long_message = "x" * 181
  lucy = double(location: 100)
  network.subscribe(lucy)
  expect(lucy).not_to receive(:hear)
  network.broadcast long_message, sean_location
end

We’ll create a 181-character message like this, place Lucy and Sean in their usual positions, subscribe Lucy on the network, and then assert that Lucy should not hear the message when it’s broadcast.

Let’s run that test. Good, it fails. Lucy’s still getting the message at the moment. Now how are we going to implement this?

It looks like we’re already implementing the proximity rule here in the broadcast method. Let’s add another if statement here about the message length.

if (message.length <= 180)
  listener.hear message
end

Run the unit test again… and it’s passing. Great.

The code here has got a little bit messy and hard to read. One very basic move we could make to improve it would be to just extract a couple of temporary variables.

within_range = (listener.location - shouter_location).abs <= @range
short_enough = message.length <= 180
if within_range && short_enough
  listener.hear message
end

That’s better. This code could be improved even further of course, but at least we haven’t made it any worse.

Run cucumber && rspec

Let’s just run the tests to check. Great - everything’s still green.
Doc Strings (0:37)

Now we have everything passing again, we can tidy up the Gherkin to use a new piece of syntax we’ve been wanting to tell you about: a DocString.

DocStrings allow you to specify a text argument for a step that spans over multiple lines. We could change our step to look like this instead:

When Sean shouts:
  """
  This is a really long message
  so long in fact that I am not going to
  be allowed to send it, at least if I keep
  typing like this until the length is over
  the limit of 180 characters.
  """

Now the scenario is much more readable.

We don’t use DocStrings very often - having such a lot of data in a test can often make it quite brittle. But when you do need it, it's useful to know about.
Close: TDD Loops (3:37)
You might have noticed that we’ve followed a pattern when we added behaviour to the system during this episode.

animation gradually drawing something like:


First we expressed the behaviour we wanted in a Gherkin scenario, wired up the step definitions, then ran Cucumber to watch it fail.

Then, we found the first class in our domain model that needed to change in order to support that new behaviour. In this case, the Network class. We used a unit test to describe how we wanted instances of that class to behave. Then we ran the unit test and watched it fail.

We focused in and made changes to the class until its unit tests were passing. When the unit tests were passing, we then made some minor changes to clean up the code and make it more readable. This is the basic test-driven-development cycle: red, green, clean.

zoom in to inner TDD loop

The technical name for this last clean-up step is refactoring. Refactoring is an ugly name for an extremely valuable activity: improving the design of existing code without changing its behaviour. You can think about it like cleaning up and washing the dishes after you’ve prepared a meal: basic housekeeping. But imagine the state of your kitchen if you never made time to do the dishes.

picture of kitchen, becoming increasingly unhygienic

Go on, imagine it for a second.

Yuck!

animate kitchen back to gleaming state

Well, that’s how many, many codebase end up. The good thing about taking this course is that we’re teaching you how to write solid automated tests, and the good thing about having solid automated tests is you can refactor with confidence, knowing that if you accidentally change the system’s behaviour, your tests will tell you.

show TDD loops again. blink / highlight the bits of the cycle as we talk about them.

Once we’re done refactoring, what do we do next? Run Cucumber, of course! In this case, our scenario was passing with a single trip round the inner TDD loop, but sometimes you can spend several hours working through all the unit tests you need to get a single scenario to green.

Once the acceptance test is passing, we figure out the next most valuable scenario on our todo list, and start the whole thing all over again!

Together, these two loops make the BDD cycle. The outer loop, which starts with an acceptance test, keeps us focussed on what the business needs us to do next. The inner loop, where we continuously test, implement then refactor small units of code, is where decide how we’ll implement that behaviour.

Both of these levels of feedback are important. It’s sometimes said that your acceptance tests ensure you’re building the right thing, and your unit tests ensure you’re building the thing right.

That’s all for this lesson of Cucumber School. See you next time!
