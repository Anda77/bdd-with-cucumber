=== Install SpecFlow

////
TODO: 
[ ] Explain that SpecFlow is a NuGet package and can be used without IDE, but easier with Visual Studio, we use Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition
[ ] Install Visual Studio extension for SpecFlow
[ ] Create a new VS project and setup SpecFlow dependencies (using xUnit, .NET Core, including Features, Support and StepDefinitions folder)
[ ] Build ('Now we’re ready to create our first feature file.')

Now we’re ready to create our first feature file.
