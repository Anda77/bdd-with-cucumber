Benny the barista wants to attract more of the people who walk past his coffee shop by offering them deals. But Benny doesn’t know how to reach them.
Claire the commuter often ends up in traffic jams she realises she could have avoided by taking a different route.

Stevie the student always seems to miss his friends when he’s out. He wishes there was a better way to find out who’s nearby.

Shouty is a social network that allows people who are physically close to communicate, just like people have always communicated with their voices. In the real world you can talk to someone in the same room, or across the street. Or even 100 m away from you in a park - if you shout.

That’s Shouty. What you say on this social network can only be “heard” by people who are nearby.
