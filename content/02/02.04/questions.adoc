What do step definitions do? (choose one) ::
  * Provide a glossary of domain terms for your stakeholders
  * Give Cucumber a way to automate your gherkin steps
  * Add extra meaning to our Gherkin steps
  * Generate code from gherkin documents
  
What does it mean when Cucumber says a step is Pending? (choose one) ::
  * The step threw a `PendingException`
  * The step took too long to execute and was terminated
  * One or more steps have been Skipped
  * Cucumber was unable to find the step definitions

Which of the following might you want to consider when using a snippet generated by Cucumber? (choose multiple) ::
  * Does the name of the method correctly describe the intent of the step?
  * Do the parameter names correctly describe the meaning of the arguments?
  * Did Cucumber generate a snippet due to a spelling inconsistency between the step and an existing step definition?
  * Does the snippet correctly automate the gherkin step as described? [false]
  
What’s the next step in BDD after we’ve pasted in the step definition snippet and seen it fail with a `pending` status? (choose one) ::
  * Check with our project manager about the requirement
  * Implement some code that does what the Gherkin step describes [true]
  * Create a test framework for modelling our application
  * Run a manual test to check what the system does
