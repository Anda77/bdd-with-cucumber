// Add new scenario

Let's create our first feature file shot::[1] using the "Add / New Item..." command. Call the file `HearShout.feature` 

shot::[2]
All feature files start with the keyword `Feature:`
shot::[3]
followed by a name.
It’s a good convention to give it a name that matches the file name. shot::[4]

.HearShout.feature
[source,gherkin]
----
Feature: Hear shout
----

shot::[5]
Now let’s write out our first scenario.

.HearShout.feature
[source,gherkin]
----
Scenario: Listener is within range
	Given Lucy is located 15m from Sean
	When Sean shouts "free bagels at Sean's"
	Then Lucy hears Sean’s message
